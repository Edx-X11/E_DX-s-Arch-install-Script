# E_DX-s-Arch-install-Script
This here is a custom install script for arch linux that i made.
i find that if i share it out to the world wide web im sure some other people may find a usecase for my script too!
if you have any ideas to make it better please let me know :}


i have also left the format as bash and .sh
